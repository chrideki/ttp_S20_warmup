# 1 - use the len function to add up sum the total number of characters in all the 
#words together in the following list
still_words = ['1','22','333','4444','55555']

for i in still_words:
    print(len(i))


# 2 - get the numeric values of the list items (eg. the value of '22' is 22), and print the sum.

sum_i = 0
for i in still_words:
    i = int(i)
    sum_i = sum_i + i
    print(i, sum_i)

# 3 - How do you fix the typo in this list, without rewriting the whole list?
words = ['one','two','three','for','five']
words[3] = 'four'
